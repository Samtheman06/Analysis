        <span>Write Max close value change (%)*:</span> &nbsp <input type="text" id="maxinc">

        <span>Write Min close value change (%)*:</span> &nbsp <input type="text" id="mininc">

        <h3>Day 2 (Today)</h3>
        <span>Write Max close value change (%):</span> &nbsp <input type="text" id="maxinc2">
        <br><br>
        <span>Write Min close value change (%):</span> &nbsp <input type="text" id="mininc2">

        <h3>Week 1  (Last Week)</h3>
        <span>Write Max close value change (%):</span> &nbsp <input type="text" id="2maxinc">
        <br><br>
        <span>Write Min close value change (%):</span> &nbsp <input type="text" id="2mininc">
        <br><br>
        <h3>Week 2 (This week)</h3>
        <span>Write Max close value change (%):</span> &nbsp <input type="text" id="2maxinc2">
        <br><br>

        <p>* The Max close value change and Min value change imply the range
          of percentages that you want to analyse. So for example, if the company was
          up 2% at close this week, then you could write Max 2,3% and Min 1,7%. This will
          compare the data with all close values and will analyse many
          things, such as, on average, what was the value change (%) the week after
          two weeks similar to these ones.</p>
